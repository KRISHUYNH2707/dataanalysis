The purpose of this project is to find mobile app profiles that are lucrative for both App Store and Google Play markets. 
In this project, we're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and our job is to enable our team of developers 
to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.

Our company only builds apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of income is from all the in-app ads. 
It means our revenue is highly dependent on the number of users that use our app. 
Our goal for this project is to collect, clean and analyse data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to grab more attention from users.
